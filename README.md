# cyberpunk-city-lottery

The draw will be made using elrond blockchain hashes for transparency. We will have 2 winners and their prizes will be given as EGLD for 1000 dollars.

The draw logic is as follows:

-28.10.2022 19:00 UTC -- Snapshots are taken

-29.10.2022 07:00 UTC -- Draw code will be shared

-29.10.2022 09:00 UTC -- We all can check the winners

You also can check the results on online python compiler websites. For example you can use this site: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/

All you need to copy the texts on draw.py file and paste on the online compiler page. You all will get the same results. 

We wish you luck :) See you on XDAY
